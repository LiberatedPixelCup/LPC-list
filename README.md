# LPC List
This is a curated list of all projects connected to the [Liberated Pixel Cup] (https://lpc.opengameart.org/) competition. It was started after the realisation that there were already resources that consolidate many LPC assets, but none that tracked games created with such assets.

LPC assets are artworks created under open licenses and following a consistent style. The original LPC competition was started on OpenGameArt.org and sponsored by the former, Mozilla, the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons. To this day, many new assets following the same style are being created by many different authors, meaning LPC is probably the largest and most comprehensive visual style available for free culture developers on OpenGameArt.

The list below only features games for now, as this kind of resource had no list collating it so far. We can expand this resource to include other things like the character generator and asset collections in the near future.
