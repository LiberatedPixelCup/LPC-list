# LPC List


This is a curated list of all projects connected to the [Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org/) competition. It was started after the realisation that there were already resources that consolidate many LPC assets, but none that tracked games created with such assets.

LPC assets are artworks created under open licenses and following a consistent style. The original LPC competition was started on OpenGameArt.org and sponsored by the former, Mozilla, the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons. To this day, many new assets following the same style are being created by many different authors, meaning LPC is probably the largest and most comprehensive visual style available for free culture developers on OpenGameArt.

It can be difficult to find games that use a few LPC assets to complement their collections, as many don't let the creators know about the use. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you know of a missing entry.

The list below only features games for now, as this kind of resource had no list collating it so far. We can expand this resource to include other things like the character generator and asset collections in the near future.


Games — Active Development
------------
* **Encyclopedia Hortica Botanica** ([Github](https://github.com/samuncle/hortica-botanica)) ([OGA Thread](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/encyclopedia-hortica-botanica-a-farming-game-made-with-godot-and-lpc-assets-0)) — Open-source farming game made in the Godot engine.

* **Stendhal** ([Website](https://arianne-project.org/game/stendhal.html))  — Free MMORPG. Uses LPC assets, but also many assets from other places; overall visual style is not LPC-oriented as it predates the LPC project by almost a decade.

Games — Original LPC Projects
------------
These games were created as part of the original 2012-2013 LPC competition.

* **Alchemist Game** ([OGA Page](https://opengameart.org/content/alchemist-game)) ([Source code on Assembla](https://app.assembla.com/spaces/alchemist-game/git/source)) — Built in Java 1.7. Built around multiplayer, single player is possible but still requires opening a separate file to start a local server.

* **Archer Man: Defender of the Unnamed Village** ([Github](https://github.com/CaptainJet/Archer_Man-Defender_of_the_Unnamed_Village)) — Defence game written in Ruby. Links to precompiled version and highscores are lost.

Outmaneuver your enemies and evade their attacks while destroying them with your own spells.

* **Big Island** ([Github](https://github.com/seveibar/liberated-pixel-cup)) ([Play online on Github.io website](https://www.seveibar.com/projects.html#big-island)) — Open-world sandbox survival. By day, players explore, hire guards and upgrade their gear; by night, they attempt to save villagers from zombies — but they can't save everyone. Won the HTML5 Grand Prize in the original LPC competition, the version currently available has had several improvements patched into it after the jam.

* **BitBrawl** ([OGA page](https://opengameart.org/content/bitbrawl)) ([Github](https://github.com/singpolyma/BitBrawl)) — PVP local multiplayer brawler.

* **Bright Frame Tactics** ([Source code at Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/gr3yh47/bfcs/src/master/)) — Turn-based tactical strategy game, 2-player hotseat multiplayer. Written in Python. Received patches a while after the contest end.

* **Castle Defense** ([OGA page](https://opengameart.org/content/castle-defense)) — Fast-paced maths game, won second place on the individual competition. The original website where you could play it online is no longer online and the Wayback Machine has no copy preserved, but OGA kept a .zip of the game's original version released for the competition.

* **Dungeon Tactics** ([IndieDB Page](https://www.indiedb.com/games/dungeon-tactics)) — Skirmish RPG that incorporates LPC sprites into a 3D game. Initial version needs to be compiled from source. Continued development for a few more versions after the initial competition release.

Players can polymorph into different shapes to overcome obstacles in a metroidvania style. FLARE engine developers contributed some code to this game's fork of the engine and vice-versa.

Original LPC Projects — Lost Media
------------
These games were created as part of the original 2012-2013 LPC competition, but have since become unavailable due to websites shutting down or file sharing links no longer working. Whenever possible, surviving media is linked below. A few projects lost without any information remaining (incl. name) are not mentioned.

* **Farm Taken Over** — Endless defence web game built with HTML5 and JavaScript. Based on a graphic novel (Three Shadows, by Cyril Pedrosa) and a short story (House Taken Over, by Julio Cortazar). Aimed to create a sense of building suspense.

* **Unsealed: Whispers of Wisdom** — Action RPG. A 2.0 version was being worked on at some point. Author uploaded some original LPC-styled assets used in the game, those are still up on [their OGA page](https://opengameart.org/users/nushio).
  
Additional Games
------------
These games are archived and known, but are not from the original LPC jam, nor do they appear to be in active development.
