# LPC List
This is a curated list of all projects connected to the [Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org/) competition. It was started after the realisation that there were already resources that consolidate many LPC assets, but none that tracked games created with such assets.

LPC assets are artworks created under open licenses and following a consistent style. The original LPC competition was started on OpenGameArt.org and sponsored by the former, Mozilla, the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons. To this day, many new assets following the same style are being created by many different authors, meaning LPC is probably the largest and most comprehensive visual style available for free culture developers on OpenGameArt.

It can be difficult to find games that use a few LPC assets to complement their collections, as many don't let the creators know about the use. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you know of a missing entry.

The list below only features games for now, as this kind of resource had no list collating it so far. We can expand this resource to include other things like the character generator and asset collections in the near future.


Games — Active Development
------------
* **Encyclopedia Hortica Botanica** ([Github](https://github.com/samuncle/hortica-botanica)) ([OGA Thread](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/encyclopedia-hortica-botanica-a-farming-game-made-with-godot-and-lpc-assets-0)) — Open-source farming game made in the Godot engine. 
* **Eternal Quest** ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385300/Eternal_Quest__2D_MMORPG/)) ([Website](https://eternal-quest.com.br/)) — MMORPG; released for Windows. Specific LPC assets used are credited in the website's "About" page. Character portraits and other elements not from LPC.
* **Herodom** ([Website](https://sites.google.com/view/herodom/home)) — Strategy game combining unit, resource and city management; released for the iPhone and iPad. Specific LPC assets used are credited in the website's "Credits" page. Components of the game and an updated [LPC character spritesheet generator](https://github.com/sanderfrenken/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator) have been open-sourced by the developer.
* **Stendhal** ([Website](https://arianne-project.org/game/stendhal.html))  — Free MMORPG. Uses LPC assets, but also many assets from other places; overall visual style is not LPC-oriented as it predates the LPC project by almost a decade.
* **Vagabond** ([Website](https://www.vagabondgame.com/)) ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1673090/Vagabond/)) ([itch.io](https://pvigier.itch.io/vagabond-demo)) — Sandbox RPG still under development; coming to Windows and Linux. Free demos are available on itch.io; the latest version as of January 2022 is Alpha 5.

Games — Original LPC Projects
------------
These games were created as part of the original 2012-2013 LPC competition.

**Work in progress - don't include unplayable (lost) games, those will go to a separate section**

https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/optional-but-appreciated-post-your-binaries-here
* **Big Island** ([Github](https://github.com/seveibar/liberated-pixel-cup)) ([Play online on Github.io website](https://www.seveibar.com/projects.html#big-island)) — Open-world sandbox survival. By day, players explore, hire guards and upgrade their gear; by night, they attempt to save villagers from zombies - but they can't save everyone. Won the HTML5 Grand Prize in the original LPC competition, the version currently available has had several improvements patched into it after the jam.
* **Castle Defense** ([OGA File](https://opengameart.org/content/castle-defense)) — Fast-paced maths game, won second place on the individual competition. The original website where you could play it online is no longer online and the Wayback Machine has no copy preserved, but OGA kept a .zip of the game's original version released for the competition.
* **Dungeon Tactics** ([IndieDB Page](https://www.indiedb.com/games/dungeon-tactics)) — Skirmish RPG that incorporates LPC sprites into a 3D game. Initial version needs to be compiled from source. Continued development for a few more versions after the initial competition release.
* **Laurelia's Polymorphable Citiziens** ([OGA File](https://opengameart.org/content/laurelias-polymorphable-citizens-0)) ([Github](https://github.com/pennomi/polymorphable)) — Action RPG using the FLARE engine, won second place in the teams competition. Players can polymorph into different shapes to overcome obstacles in a metroidvania style. FLARE engine developers contributed some code to this game's fork of the engine and vice-versa.
* **Lurking Patrol Comrades/Source of Tales** ([Repositories](https://opengameart.org/content/lurking-patrol-comrades)) ([Website](http://www.sourceoftales.org/)) — MMORPG that uses the same client as The Mana World. Won the Grand Prize in the original LPC competition and continued development under the second name listed, but the website seems to have gone inactive shortly afterwards.
*  **Sorcerer's Garden** ([Github](https://github.com/sanojian/lpc_sorc_garden)) — RPG, post-jam updates exist in a separate branch.
* **Unsealed: Whispers of Wisdom** ([Github](https://github.com/Nushio/Unsealed)) — Action RPG. Compiled .jar files for running on Windows, Mac or Linux included. A separate branch has work on a 2.0 version. The initial version shipped to the judges was hosted on the developer's website, but it is no longer online.
