# LPC List
This is a curated list of all projects connected to the [Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org/) competition. It was started after the realisation that there were already resources that consolidate many LPC assets, but none that tracked games created with such assets.

LPC assets are artworks created under open licenses and following a consistent style. The original LPC competition was started on OpenGameArt.org and sponsored by the former, Mozilla, the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons. To this day, many new assets following the same style are being created by many different authors, meaning LPC is probably the largest and most comprehensive visual style available for free culture developers on OpenGameArt.

It can be difficult to find games that use a few LPC assets to complement their collections, as many don't let the creators know about the use. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you know of a missing entry.

The list below only features games for now, as this kind of resource had no list collating it so far. We can expand this resource to include other things like the character generator and asset collections in the near future.


Games — Active Development
------------
* **Eternal Quest** ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385300/Eternal_Quest__2D_MMORPG/)) ([Website](https://eternal-quest.com.br/)) — MMORPG; released for Windows. Specific LPC assets used are credited in the website's "About" page. Character portraits other elements not from LPC.
* **Herodom** ([Website](https://sites.google.com/view/herodom/home)) — Strategy game combining unit, resource and city management; released for the iPhone and iPad. Specific LPC assets used are credited in the website's "Credits" page. Components of the game and an updated [LPC character spritesheet generator](https://github.com/sanderfrenken/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator) have been open-sourced by the developer.
* **Stendhal** ([Website](https://arianne-project.org/game/stendhal.html))  — Free MMORPG. Uses LPC assets, but also many assets from other places; overall visual style is not LPC-oriented as it predates the LPC project by almost a decade.
* **Vagabond** ([Website](https://www.vagabondgame.com/)) ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1673090/Vagabond/)) ([itch.io](https://pvigier.itch.io/vagabond-demo)) — Sandbox RPG still under development; coming to Windows and Linux. Free demos are available on itch.io; the latest version as of January 2022 is Alpha 5.
